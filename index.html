					<h2>Mandelbrot Fractals</h2>
					<time datetime='2023-12-20'>20th, December 2023.</time>
				</div>
				<div class='blog-item-descr'>
					<p>
					Fractals are infinitely self repeating mathematical structures.
					Mandelbrot Fractal is probably the most well known of all of them.
					The self referencial structure makes them perfect candidate for computer generation.

					<h2>Fractal Explorer</h2>
					<time datetime='2023-05-20'>20th, May 2023.</time>
				</div>
				<div class='blog-item-descr'>
					<p>
					Two blogposts about fractals seems a bit odd but I can assure you its anything but.
					This post talks about how a fractal explorer can be implemented in the graphics card
					using opengl. Modern Graphics cards have immense power at their disposal. Even the ones
					that are built into the CPU dies enable the user to create thousands of parallel computation
					units.This project was built as the final project of CS50.

					<h2>Boolean Function Reducer</h2>
					<time datetime='2023-12-22'>22nd, December 2023.</time>
				</div>
				<div class='blog-item-descr'>
					<p>
					Reducing Boolean Functions is a war not worth fighting, its almost always better to just
					ship off the work to a machine designed to do the drudge work. This program does just that.
					It works well enough for 10 variables and that i think is more than enough for most applications.

				</div>
				<div class='blog-item-descr'>
					<p>
					Not unlike the next person I absolutely love playing the T-game.
					I won't name the game since even naming it is inviting a lawsuit.
					It was a ton of fun recreating this piece of gaming history, a blast from the past.
					Although old its much more complicated that it would seem at first glance.
					Bestpart the whole game is a single C file, which compiles both for window and linux
					(should compile for mac aswell :).

					<h2>Chip-8 Emulator</h2>
					<time datetime='2022-03-14'>14th, March 2022.</time>
				</div>
				<div class='blog-item-descr'>
					<p>
					Implementing real harware as software has a tremendous feeling to it that can not be described in
					words. Although Chip-8 is not a real system it is a emulator running on hardware. It is probably 
					the easiest game console to emulate. The picture is of the emulator running a game. I have no idea
					why I chose those obnoxious colors for the monochrome display but its cool.

					<h2>Construct The Future</h2>
					<time datetime='2021-09-05'>5th, September 2021.</time>
				</div>
				<div class='blog-item-descr'>
					<p>
					Construct The Future is not a game in the traditional sense of the term. It is a celullar automaton simulator. There
					are several types of 'materials' available to play with. It can also be used to draw. This was my first
					game for the OLC codejam.

					<h2>HTTP Server</h2>

				<div class='blog-item-descr'>
					<p>
					Something things just interest me for no reason and this was one of those times.
					This is not by any means a usable HTTP server, it does not handle all types of 
					requests. It does not maintain an open connection and like the old times reconnects
					each a request is made. But as a learning tool it was excellent.

					<h2>Smear Lang</h2>
					<time datetime='2021-10-15'>15nd, October 2021.</time>
				</div>
				<div class='blog-item-descr'>
					<p>
					Smear Lang is a experimental programming language like lisp. It just transpiles
					to lua from a weird lisp like syntax. A Year back I found out about the MAL project,
					it was amazing. But I was too scared (i have no idea why!) to fork the MAL repo and build
					a LISP so I decided that i would just make my own version. It is very scuffed and does
					not even have proper error handling. Not my proudest projects.
